# AI_Vision_Lab

A modular computer vision laboratory built with Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit.
It integrates classical image processing and deep learning-based face detection into a single interactive platform.

---

## Overview

AI_Vision_Lab is an interactive CV playground that allows users to:

- Upload images for processing
- Apply classical OpenCV operations
- Perform AI-based face detection (Haar / DNN)
- Run real-time webcam face detection
- Switch between models dynamically

The goal is to build a **modular AI vision system**, not just standalone scripts.

## Features

### Image Processing
- Grayscale conversion
- Gaussian Blur
- Canny Edge Detection
- Histogram Equalization
- Morphological operations (dilate / erode)

### AI Vision
- Face Detection (Haar Cascade)
- Face Detection (DNN - deep learning)
- Confidence threshold control

### Webcam Mode
- Real-time webcam stream
- Live face detection
- Model switching (Haar / DNN)

## System Design

```
Streamlit UI
   ↓
Model Selector
   ↓
model_registry.py
   ↓
OpenCV / DNN modules
   ↓
Processed output
```

Key idea: **separation of UI and model logic** for scalability.
